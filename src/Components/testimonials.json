You have changed the way I think and the way I think about myself. So thank you for that I was going to Wright you a letter during lunch yesterday but I forgot sorry about that. But when I read what you said I released that I really really don't want school to be over and I don't want my friends and teachers to not be there for me. One thing I know now is that you will always be there for me and you will always show how much you love me. When I wrote in your year book I had the same thought you did that I now have to write a novel. I am glad you get me for two more years and I am glad that you get to teach me all through my first teenage years. You will be the one teacher I will remember through out my life. If I were to have wrote all the things I want to say to you I would still be writing. What I wrote in your year book was just a small part of how I feel and how you have changed who I am and what I want to be I am hoping I can finish one of my books I am writing especially the one about you. So you can edit them for me and maybe some time get them published. When I grow up I want to be a junior high history teacher and a published author and also a attorney one day to. Thank you for believing in me and making me feel I can do what ever I want to do. You have inspired me in every way possible so thank you! I hope I haven't made you cry. I love you like a dad!",

//         When I first came to history at Lumen and I met you I thought you were funny, cool, awesome and a great teacher, but as I have gotten to know you I have realized you are more than a great teacher. You are an AMAZING teacher! If I didn't have you in my life I would not have made it through my dad passing. You are a fatherly image to me and I'm so glad I have you in my life. It'll be a pretty hard summer for me, but I always know you will be there for me. I can't wait for the Defence Against the Dark Arts class and I especially can't wait for school to start again.

You have been the best teacher I have ever had in my life, and still will be in twenty years. You have helped me through the roughest times in seventh grade, and celebrated me in the best times. I know I was sometimes a pain to have as a student, but I hope you can forgive me for the mistakes I made. I hope you know what an impact you have had in my life. I will love you forever Chris Kringle!",

Thank you for making my school year meaningful and giving me opportunities that I would not have given otherwise. Your impact on my life has helped me in many ways. Thank you for your help and I hope to see you next year and in years to come. Thank you for your participation in my education as well as putting up with my random spasms of fangirling and vehement disagreements with the persons of history. Thank you for pushing me to my limits and helping me discover new horizons in my education as well as in my writing. You have helped me discover new worlds as well as new people. You have helped me discover daring heroes and cunning spies; people that I formerly thought only existed in books. Thank you.",

It made me feel like he truly cares about me, and everybody in the class. Mr. C is my most favorite teacher like... EVER! He cares about us learning and wants us to grow up to be successful, and would do whatever it takes to make that happen. He crams every little bit of knowledge into our heads, and teaches us in ways that almost force us to have fun. We learned without knowing it, and if we did know it (that we were learning) it was fun. I have never frowned in his class, or had any amount of displeasure whatsoever. What really stood out to me is that on the last day of school he still was wanting us to learn, and he was saying how we had a friend in him. Every class I left with my head playing America over and over again. When we learned about the civil war and he told us about how war was an awful, terrible, dirty thing. It made me want to cancel every war, and bring every lost soldier back. It made me want to fight less and be nicer, in my own circle of influence. The way he taught about the Berlin Wall and how it personally affected him when it came down really helped me to appreciate things I've never really thought about before, like our freedom and what it really means to live in America (a privilege). Through studying history with Mr C I've realized the importance of knowing our history. People in America's history went through things much worse than we will ever know and they kept a straight face and just kept moving forward. They worked hard and contributed to making America an amazing place and that makes me want to be a better person. Someone that doesn't complain and that actually contributes to making our country great every day. The only way to describe Mr C is supercalifragilisticexpyalidocious. Chuck Norris wears Mr. C pajamas. I recommend his class because of this.",
