          ELO--Ex Libris Optimis (Out of the Best Books)--is a dream level class
          in reading. For reading. About reading. Including a lot of reading.{" "}

          We talk about 'scholar phase' as if it were going to happen by itself
          once a child reaches a certain point. My experience is that it only
          happens when the child--or adult--has the skills to learn from
          everything their mind takes in. Most of the time, that means learning
          how to read everything closely, meticulously, with appreciation and
          critical analysis. That's what this class is for. We will read
          widely--nonfiction, fiction, essays, short stories, poetry (short and
          long-form) with a couple of plays tossed in for good measure. <br />
          There will be classics, popular literature, children's books, sci-fi,
          fantasy, historical, and everything in between. <br />
          <br />
          Students will be expected to have read the week's material before
          coming to class, and be prepared for in-depth discussion and analysis
          of the text. Some writing--but this is not a writing class. Heavy on
          discussion and reading, the class demands that a student have 5 or so
          hours a week to read and think about the work under scrutiny. <br />
          Appropriate for age 14 and up, with exceptions for younger students on
          a case-by-case basis.<br />
