            Thank you for being the greatest teacher on planet earth. You have
            changed my life and the life of many others. You have changed the
            way I think and the way I think about myself. So thank you for that.
            But when I read what you said I released that I really really don't
            want school to be over and I don't want my friends and teachers to
            not be there for me. When I wrote in your year book I had the same
            thought you did that I now have to write a novel. I am glad you get
            me for two more years and I am glad that you get to teach me all
            through my first teenage years. You will be the one teacher I will
            remember through out my life. If I were to have wrote all the things
            I want to say to you I would still be writing. What I wrote in your
            year book was just a small part of how I feel and how you have
            changed who I am and what I want to be I am hoping I can finish one
            of my books I am writing especially the one about you. So you can
            edit them for me and maybe some time get them published. When I grow
            up I want to be a junior high history teacher and a published author
            and also a attorney one day to. Thank you for believing in me and
            making me feel I can do what ever I want to do. You have inspired me
            in every way possible so thank you! I hope I haven't made you cry.

            I have never had a teacher like you before. When I first came to
            history at Lumen and I met you I thought you were funny, cool,
            awesome and a great teacher, but as I have gotten to know you I have
            realized you are more than a great teacher. You are an AMAZING
            teacher! If I didn't have you in my life I would not have made it
            through my dad passing. You are a fatherly image to me and I'm so
            glad I have you in my life. It'll be a pretty hard summer for me,
            but I always know you will be there for me. I can't wait for the
            Defence Against the Dark Arts class and I especially can't wait for
            school to start again. I just wanted to let you know that I think
            you are amazing.

            Thank you! We love you Mr. C! I wish as much of a marvelous summer
            to you as you have wished us. Thank you for making my school year
            meaningful and giving me opportunities that I would not have given
            otherwise. Your impact on my life has helped me in many ways. Thank
            you for your help and I hope to see you next year and in years to
            come. Thank you for your participation in my education as well as
            putting up with my random spasms of fangirling and vehement
            disagreements with the persons of history. Thank you for pushing me
            to my limits and helping me discover new horizons in my education as
            well as in my writing. You have helped me discover new worlds as
            well as new people. You have helped me discover daring heroes and
            cunning spies; people that I formerly thought only existed in books.
            Thank you.

            The may 16th class was definitely my favorite. When Mr C was saying
            goodbye he reminded us that we always have a friend in him and if we
            ever needed help we could talk to him. It made me feel like he truly
            cares about me, and everybody in the class. Mr. C is my most
            favorite teacher like... EVER! He cares about us learning and wants
            us to grow up to be successful, and would do whatever it takes to
            make that happen. He crams every little bit of knowledge into our
            heads, and teaches us in ways that almost force us to have fun. We
            learned without knowing it, and if we did know it (that we were
            learning) it was fun. I have never frowned in his class, or had any
            amount of displeasure whatsoever. What really stood out to me is
            that on the last day of school he still was wanting us to learn, and
            he was saying how we had a friend in him. Every class I left with my
            head playing America over and over again. When we learned about the
            civil war and he told us about how war was an awful, terrible, dirty
            thing. It made me want to cancel every war, and bring every lost
            soldier back. It made me want to fight less and be nicer, in my own
            circle of influence. The way he taught about the Berlin Wall and how
            it personally affected him when it came down really helped me to
            appreciate things I've never really thought about before, like our
            freedom and what it really means to live in America (a privilege).
            Through studying history with Mr C I've realized the importance of
            knowing our history. People in America's history went through things
            much worse than we will ever know and they kept a straight face and
            just kept moving forward. They worked hard and contributed to making
            America an amazing place and that makes me want to be a better
            person. Someone that doesn't complain and that actually contributes
            to making our country great every day. The only way to describe Mr C
            is supercalifragilisticexpyalidocious. Chuck Norris wears Mr. C
            pajamas. I recommend his class because of this.

            Mr. C. I hated history before your class. I thought it was boring
            and stupid. But the way you thought and the energy in your lessons
            literally made me love it more than a lot of things. Thank you.

            Mr. C is a middle school history teacher at Lumen, but he isn't just
            a teacher. Mr. C does teach history, but he does it in such a fun
            way. In Mr. C's class every student is wide awake and ready to
            learn. I've heard students say they used to despise history, and it
            was their least favorite subject. Then those students said they
            found Me. C and history came to life for them. Other student said
            Mr. C's class is like Disneyland. We're on rides, rides of fun,
            learning that will stick and stay. The history sticks in your head,
            but Mr. C sticks in your heart. We LOVE Mr. C!

            Hey Mr. C, I just want you to know I miss you. You were a great
            teacher and you helped me find purpose, you showed that you cared
            and that I wasn't just someone in the crowd. I can never thank you
            enough.

            Hey Mr. C! Can I just start by saying thank you so so so so much!
            Honestly, you brought to light so many questions that I have had
            personally buried deeper in myself then I care to admit. Because of
            your passion and inspiration, I was able to really reflect on myself
            and these questions I have. Although not all of them have been
            answered I am well on my way to not only finding the answer but
            understanding it as well. I'd be more than happy to share with you
            how and when I find these answers, but as for now, thank you for the
            impact you have made on me. I have been set into motion past the
            outer stars (Probably way past Karak) and I can't wait to see what I
            discover. Thank you again!
