          DADA, as we affectionately call it, is a class on media defense, using
          commercials, video, film, books, memes, and all the other kinds of
          media youth consume today to show hidden messages that make it into
          our minds—and if we’re not careful, we will never even know. Here’s
          how to see those messages, understand them, and make choices about
          whether we agree, defending ourselves against these dark arts and
          making good decisions about what we do and do not spend our time with.<br />
          Lots of video, both watching and making; reading, laughing, and
          tomfoolery. Hey. It’s a summer class, not a PhD seminar.<br /><br />
