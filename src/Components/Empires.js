          Three Empires is a tour through the three great classical empires,
          Egypt, Greece, and Rome. From the beginnings of world civilization
          with the uniting of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms, through the fall of
          the Empire, we will trace Egyptian cultural achievements in writing,
          architecture, government, and literature--including the potential
          origins of Cinderella! Then on to Greece, first with the Minoan Empire
          and Theseus, the mystery of Atlantis, and on to the Iliad, the
          Odyssey, Thermopylae, Solon, Pericles, Demosthenes, Aeschylus,
          Sophocles, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle (among others), and a
          student of his named Alexander. <br />
          <br /> We finish with the greatest of the ancient republics, one of
          the greatest empires the world has seen. From Tarquin, through Aeneas
          and Romulus and Remus, through Horatius at the Bridge, Cincinnatus the
          Dictator, the Republic, Caesar and the rise of Empire, through the
          good, the bad, and the ugly of a thousand years of Emperors, we will
          see the art, literature, philosophy, religion, and government of the
          most influential of the ancient empires on our lives today. <br />{" "}
